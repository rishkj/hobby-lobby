			<p align="center"><i>Welcome to Hobby Lobby-The ultimate extra curriculum hub. Here at Hobby Lobby, we encourage youngsters to explore and build their creative side. We provide a platform to encourage our students to take a stand on their hobbies. This builds their confidence and is a push to their overall personilty development.<br><br>

					Hobby Lobby was a vision that was established on 5th November, 1995 in Bangalore. It was initiated by Jeevana Hegde and Rishbah Jain, two renown artists. Hobby Lobby was a small franchise that had to undergo major turns as "arts" was not a widely supported and believed idea back in that period. However, it took a leap forward as it had a turn-out that was more than expected. This helped Hobby Lobby grow and extend to other cities across India including Delhi and Mumbai.<br><br>
